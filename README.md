# Code Geek

This repo is dedicated to store all of programing interview test from a very simple one to a very hardest one, algorithm implementation, mini console game like tetris or pacman maybe and all of geeky code. The aim of this repo is to help people to learn algorithm better and find solution that maybe useful in the future.

## Prerequisites

In order to run all example in this repository you need to have

- Linux
  - General
    - `make` command - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs
  - C
    - C programmming language
    - `gcc` - GNU project C and C++ compiler
  - Go
    - [Go programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install)
    - `go` command
  - Java
    - [Java programming language](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)
    - `javac` and `java` - Java project for compile and running

- macOS
  - General
    - `brew` command - Brew or Homebrew calls itself The missing package manager for macOS and is an essential tool for any developer.
  - C Family Languages
    - `clang` - Xcode shipped with clang compiler for C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift for free.
    - Xcode required for most macOS development tools to run.
  - Go
    - `go` command
  - Java
    - JDK required for compile and running Java project

  macOS setup tutorial for development in various tools can be found in [macOS Setup - Sourabh Bajaj](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/).

## How to run

### Go

- Sort
  - To run all of go sort example please run `go run go/sort/*` and you will get all of the output sample or just simply use `make go_sort`.
- Manipulation
  - To run all of go sort example please run `go run go/manipulation/*` and you will get all of the output sample or just simply use `make go_manipulation`.
- Recursion
  - To run all of go sort example please run `go run go/recursion/*` and you will get all of the output sample or just simply use `make go_recursion`.
- String
  - To run all of go sort example please run `go run go/string/*` and you will get all of the output sample or just simply use `make go_string`.

### C

- Sort
  - use command `gcc -o c/sort/main c/sort/main.c` to generate compiled file and then run it with `./c/sort/main` or just simply use `make c_sort`

### Java
- use command `javac filename.java` to generate compiled file and then run it with `java filename.class`.
